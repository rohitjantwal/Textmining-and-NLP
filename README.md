# Textmining-and-NLP
Identifying bug reports using text mining:

In our project we are categorising BR into sbr and nsbr . for this we have developed a software which
preprocess give dataset , user needs to input some attributes and the naive bayes algorithm calculates the
final value (ie. Sbr or nsbr) and the result is known. Another software uses NLP algortithm and category is
updated is new database.
We are now following a new approach that applies text mining on natural-language descriptions of BRs to
learn a statistical model to classify a BR as either an SBR or an NSBR. With the help of our approach,
security engineers can feasibly apply our proposed approach on NSBRs from a BTS to effectively identify
SBRs, without inspecting each single NSBR from a BTS.
Text mining uses natural-language processing to parse terms (i.e., words and phrases) from a document to
create a term-by-document frequency matrix. Table I shows a simple, hypothetical term-by-document
matrix.
